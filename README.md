## Instructions

You have an implementation of `FizzBuzz`, with a `Game` class that has a `main` method to let you run it.
Unfortunately the author of the code has made more than a few mistakes, it's your job to identify and fix them, as per the below:

* **Don't use an IDE** use a plain text editor such as Atom https://atom.io/
* List all the errors you can see in the file
* Once you have a list of all the errors try to correct them - still without using your IDE, or a compiler!
* When you think you have a correct submission - send it to your mentor for testing.....

This exercise is intended to cover some of the following objectives from the OCA book:

## OCA exam objectives covered in chapter 1:

### Java Basics

* Define the scope of variables
* Define the structure of a Java class
* Create executable Java applications with a main method; run a Java program from the command line; including console output
* Import other Java packages to make them accessible in your code
* Compare and contrast the features and components of Java such as platform independence, object orientation, encapsulation, etc.

### Working with Java Data Types

* Declare and initialize variables (including casting or primitive types)
* Differentiate between object reference variables and primitive variables
* Know how to read or write to object fields
* Explain an Object's Lifecycle (creation, “dereference by reassignment” and garbage collection)

## OCA exam objectives covered in chapter 2:

### Using Operators and Decision Constructs

* Use Java operators; including parentheses to override operator precedence
* Create if and if/else and ternary constructs
* Use a switch statement

### Using Loop Constructs

* Create and use while loops
* Create and use for loops including the enhanced for loop
* Create and use do/while loops
* Compare loop constructs
* Use break and continue
